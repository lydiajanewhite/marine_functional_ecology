You don't need to download the data, they will be directly accessed by the R scripts :sunglasses:

The four scripts provide a workflow for analysis and figures for Marine Functional Ecology course 2023. 

Examples of each type of analysis are given, that can be adapted to explore other variables that you have collected.  

Overall goal of the course is to explore differences in carbon stocks, carbon fluxes and the ecological communities which underpin these, between different sites around Tv√§rminne Zoological Station.
