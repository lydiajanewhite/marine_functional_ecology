# Functional Marine Ecology practical exercise
 
Overall aim of the course is to obtain skills to describe the link between the structure and function of coastal ecosystems. 

In groups, students will collect their own data from contrasting sites over the duration of the field course, data, however, will be pooled together for analysis to allow comparisons between sites. 

## Input data

Data during 2024 course will be organised into spreadsheet here: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fXSKn11OsET_SrR7sIbFTcflnglbaVWv44oULKhfo4s/edit?usp=sharing

2023 example data can be found here:

2022 example data can be found here:

You don't need to download the data, they will be directly accessed by the R scripts :sunglasses:

Due to time constraints, response variable names used in the scripts already appear in the spreadsheets, allowing data to be easily pooled.  
The four scripts provide a workflow for analysis and data visualization for Marine Functional Ecology course 2024, covering a range of univariate and multivariate techniques. 

Examples of each type of analysis are given, which you are expected to adapt to other response variables that you have measured during the field course.    

Overall goal of the course is to explore differences in carbon stocks, carbon fluxes and the ecological communities which underpin these, between different sites around Tv√§rminne Zoological Station.
